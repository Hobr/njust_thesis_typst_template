	abstract = {T h s paper outlines the concept, development, and use of the Comprehensive {TEX} Archive Network ({CTAN})-a network-accessible archve for files related to the {TEX} family of document processing. The {CTAN} is a coordinated effort among consenting well-known archve sites which provides quick identification and retrieval files in a consistent manner from hosts on different continents, thereby reducing overall network load and increasing speed of retrieval. Moreover, it provides users with a parallel archive structure between hosts with holdings whch are generally synchronized to w i t h 30 hours of one another. This is achieved by routinely mirroring one another's holdings, as well as mirroring other archves to maintain an up-to-date collection of files.},
