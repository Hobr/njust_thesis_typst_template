Installing all these software packages is a formidable task because each one has a different procedure for compiling or for placing the ﬁles required at run time. The {LUDE} (Logithèque Universitaire Distribuée et Extensible) software library is an organization for installing software packages, a set of tools to install and uninstall software packages and browse their documentation, and a number of {FTP} servers offering over 100 pre-installed freely redistributable software packages. It offers functionality and ﬂexibility not available in existing systems.},

	abstract = {T h s paper outlines the concept, development, and use of the Comprehensive {TEX} Archive Network ({CTAN})-a network-accessible archve for files related to the {TEX} family of document processing. The {CTAN} is a coordinated effort among consenting well-known archve sites which provides quick identification and retrieval files in a consistent manner from hosts on different continents, thereby reducing overall network load and increasing speed of retrieval. Moreover, it provides users with a parallel archive structure between hosts with holdings whch are generally synchronized to w i t h 30 hours of one another. This is achieved by routinely mirroring one another's holdings, as well as mirroring other archves to maintain an up-to-date collection of files.},

	title = {Nix: A Safe and Policy-Free System for Software Deployment},
	abstract = {Existing systems for software deployment are neither safe nor sufficiently flexible. Primary safety issues are the inability to enforce reliable specification of component dependencies, and the lack of support for multiple versions or variants of a component. This renders deployment operations such as upgrading or deleting components dangerous and unpredictable. A deployment system must also be flexible (i.e., policy-free) enough to support both centralised and local package management, and to allow a variety of mechanisms for transferring components. In this paper we present Nix, a deployment system that addresses these issues through a simple technique of using cryptographic hashes to compute unique paths for component instances.},
